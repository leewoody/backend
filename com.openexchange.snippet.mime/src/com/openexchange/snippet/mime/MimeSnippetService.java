/**
 * {@link MimeSnippetService} - The "filestore" using snippet service.
 * <p>
 * <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;How SnippetService selection works</b>
 * <hr>
 * <p>
 * The check if "filestore" capability is available/permitted as per CapabilityService is performed through examining
 * "MimeSnippetService.neededCapabilities()" method in "SnippetAction.getSnippetService()".
 * <p>
 * Available SnippetServices are sorted rank-wise, with RdbSnippetService having default (0) ranking and MimeSnippetService with a rank of
 * 10. Thus MimeSnippetService is preferred provided that "filestore" capability is indicated by CapabilityService.
 * <p>
 * If missing, RdbSnippetService is selected.
