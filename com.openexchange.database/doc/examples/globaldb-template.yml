# Configuration file for global, cross-context databases

# Please ensure that the same version of this configuration file is used for 
# all nodes in the cluster.

# By default, no database is configured, so that features that require access
# to the cross-context database are not available.

# For each cross-context database, the database pool identifier, as well as 
# the associated context groups need to be specified. The "id" property refers
# to the database pool identifier of the corresponding database master of the 
# targeted pool, previously registered with "./registerdatabase". The 
# identifier is also printed out when executing the "./listdatabase" 
# commandline tool.
 
# In most cases, it's sufficient to configure the same global database 
# settings for the whole user base of the installation. For that purpose, the 
# "default" section is used, and no further configuration steps are necessary 
# after the referenced database has been registered.

# For setups serving multiple different "brands" or "domains", one or more 
# contexts can be classified into a specific "group". The association with
# the group is done by assigning the property "com.openexchange.context.group"
# to a context via config cascade. A context may only be part of one group,
# contexts without group association automatically fall into the "default"
# group. 

# Having contexts separated into different groups also allows to use different
# global databases as defined in the additional sections of this configuration 
# file. Context groups are bound to each configuration section by specifying 
# the group name in the "groups" array. 
# Each group name can only be specified in one section. The name of each
# configuration block may be chosen freely, yet the referenced group names 
# have to match the actual values assigned to the contexts via 
# "com.openexchange.context.group".

# Besides using different database schemas for the cross-context database, the 
# context group names also serve as differentiating key for various data held 
# in the global databases. For example, data of a guest user that was invited 
# to a share in one context of a group can be used throughout all other 
# contexts of the same group. Or, there may be a different set of registered 
# OAuth applications available for each context group.


# Section for the "default" global database. The configuration becomes active 
# once the "id" is defined.

# Example for an additional configuration setting that directs all cross-
# context data from the context groups "de", "fr" and "nl" to the database
# pool with identifier 32. As outlined above, contexts may be assigned to 
# those groups via config cascade.
