/**
 * This bug is concerned with data sent as UTF8 stream with a Byte Order Mark (BOM).
 * UTF8 does not need one (it would be pointless actually, since the main improvements
 * of UTF8 are dynamic length and backwards-compatibility to US-ASCII). It is actually
 * recommended not to use one, but of course, some Windows programs insist on using
 * one anyway. This test tries out several BOMs to prove that the import works even
 * in those weird situations.
