/**
 * OX uses different ways of limiting/ending a series: You can use an ending date or you can define a number of occurrences. This
 * information needs to be kept (you cannot just convert one into the other), because changing this series might have different
 * implications, eg.: If you move a daily series two days closer to the end date, you might lose two occurrences - if you move a series with
 * 7 occurrences, moving does not matter.
