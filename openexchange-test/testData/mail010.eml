There are now 3 threads on this subject and not one helpming me fix the
pro=
blem.
So, please refer to my FIRST post and try helping me.

As said, the problem is, that if I mount and unmount/unplug/eject an
external usb disk, and then again try to mount it, the OS will say it
is as readonly, even thought mount command says it RW.
I've used both the mound command to manually mount the device, and the
Nautilus tool.

Any (good and on point) ideias?
