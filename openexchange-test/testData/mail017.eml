Welcome.
Greetings. It=E2=80=99s been a very busy last month around here. Many of =
you probably saw we closed a $25M financing:=20
http://www.splunk.com/index.php/affiliate_redirect?domain=3Damericanventur=
emagazine&uri=3D/news.php?newsid=3D3428&ac=3Dns0901.=20
This is the fuel we need to continue innovating. In addition to shipping =
3.0 this summer we =
(http://blogs.splunk.com/thebaum/2007/08/05/agile-what?ac=3Dns0907-2)
retooled our complete product development methodology. See more at =
http://blogs.splunk.com/thebaum/2007/08/05/agile-what?ac=3Dns0907-2.=20
Our more agile focus lets us move in parallel on many projects at the same =
time. When you submit an enhancement request=20
or bug to support@splunk.com, it now goes directly to the engineers and =
product managers. The whole idea is to continue=20
to find new ways to communicate transparently with everyone in the Splunk =
community.

Along those lines, we've given a major facelift and moved all of our =
Splunk support forums to the new SplunkBase.=20
See http://blogs.splunk.com/thebaum/2007/09/18/splunkbase-gets-a-big-face-=
lift?ac=3Dns0907-3. We=E2=80=99ve always said,=20
"we only build things we ourselves use." Be sure to check out the Add-Ons =
section where you can download all kinds=20
of goodness for your Splunk server and let us know what you think of the =
new SplunkBase.

We remain completely focused on building the Splunk community =E2=80=93 we =
want to help you share your issues, ideas,=20
and solutions. Enjoy Splunkvox and happy splunking.
Michael Baum, CEO and Co-founder


What's New
As of 3.0.2, we now have an AIX version - that's right, you can run Splunk =
on AIX. Whether you just need to access data
on AIX and forward it to another Splunk server already running on another =
platform, or you want to run your entire=20
deployment on AIX! We support AIX 5.2 and 5.3. Get it? Want it? Download =
it now at http://www.splunk.com/index.php/landing?ac=3Dns0907-5

Tips & Tricks
Have you ever tried to extend Splunk with your own event processor?
Custom search commands (http://www.splunk.com/doc/3.0.2/developer/searchpr=
ocessors/&ac=3Dns0907-6) are the Splunk
 features that enable you to do this. You can find an example =
implementation of a custom search command in the AfterGlow=20
add-on on SplunkBase at http://www.splunk.com/index.php/affiliate_redirect=
?domain=3Dsplunkbase&uri=3D/addons/All/Splunk/addon:AfterGlow_Graphing&ac=
=3Dns0907-7.=20
It allows you to pass events into the afterglow custom command to have it =
generate a link graph of relationships in the events.=20
You can find a sample visualization of firewall traffic SecViz.org on =
http://secviz.org/?q=3Dnode/13.
Want to learn how to do it yourself? Read up on creating search commands =
at http://www.splunk.com/doc/3.0.2/developer/searchprocessors/&ac=3Dns0907=
-9.=20
Or have a look at http://blogs.splunk.com/raffy/2007/09/16/afterglow-and-s=
plunk?ac=3Dns0907-10, which talks in more detail about the AfterGlow =
integration.
Next time we'll talk about how to build field actions to find where an IP =
address is located on the globe.
