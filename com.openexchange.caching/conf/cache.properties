# Configures how remote cache invalidation is done. Set to 'true' for cache events via the cache event messaging service, or to 'false'
# to stick with the JCS-internal lateral auxiliary cache configuration. Defaults to 'true'.
com.openexchange.caching.jcs.eventInvalidation=true

# Specifies if changes to personal folders (personal in terms of non-global e.g. folders kept in database) are supposed to be propagated
# to remote nodes. This option is only useful for installations that do offer collaboration features or do not support session stickyness.
# For instance users are able to share mail folders or might be load-balanced to other nodes while active in a single session.

# Default is 'false'
