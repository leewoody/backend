      Gets the quota limits and current usage for the storage the supplied root folder belongs to. Depending on
      the filestore configuration, this may include both restrictions on the number of allowed files and the total
      size of all contained files in bytes. If there's no limit, -1 is returned.

        description: |
          A JSON object containing a field `quota` that is an array of quota objects. The array size may be zero, one
          or two, depending on the filestore configuration. If one or more quota types are missing in the array, the
          client can expect that there are no limitations for that type. Besides the array, the JSON object also contains
          a hyperlink behind the `manageLink` field, poiting to an URL where the user can manage his quota restrictions.
          In case of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled.
