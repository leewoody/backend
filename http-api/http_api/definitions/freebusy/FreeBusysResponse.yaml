      The free/busy data for all requested participants inside a JSON object with the participant IDs as keys,
      like `{"data":{"3":{"data":[{"start_date":...},{"start_date":...]}},"19":{"data":[{"start_date":...}]}}}`. Besides a combined data
      element for a requested group, all group members are resolved and listed separately in the result. If the `merged` parameter
      is specified, an additional data element named `merged` representing a combined view for all requested participants is added
      to the results implicity.
