    summary: Updates a mail or a folder's messages and/or moves a mail to another folder.
    description: |
      The update request can perform an update of the color label and flags of one mail object. Beside it
      is possible to change the mail's folder, meaning move the mail to another folder. Both operations
      can be performed at once too.
      
      If neither parameter `id` nor parameter `message_id` is specified, all folder's messages are updated
      accordingly.
