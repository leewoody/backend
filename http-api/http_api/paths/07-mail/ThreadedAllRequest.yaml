          A JSON object containing an array of objects, each representing a conversation's root message along
          with its message thread. The root message's JSON object is filled according to the specified `columns`
          and is enhanced by a special `thread` field representing the full message thread (including the root
          message itself). `thread` is a JSON array of objects each representing a message in the conversation
          sorted by time-line and filled with the specified `columns`. Not IMAP: with timestamp. In case of
          errors the responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
