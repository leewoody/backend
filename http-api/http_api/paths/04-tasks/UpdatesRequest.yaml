        description: |
          An array with new, modified and deleted tasks. New and modified tasks are represented by arrays. The
          elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding identifiers in the `columns`
          parameter. Deleted tasks would be identified by their object IDs as integers, without being part of
          a nested array. In case of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled (see
          [Error handling](#error-handling)).
