      Filters are grouped into categories, the so called facets.
      #### Facets
      The style of a facet is responsible for how the according object is structured, how it is handled on the
      server-side and how the client has to handle it. We distinguish three styles of facets:
       * simple
       * default
       * exclusive
      ___
      Every facet value contains an embedded `filter` object. The filter must not be changed by the client, it has
      to be seen as a black-box. Instead the filters of selected facet values have to be copied and sent to the
      server with the subsequent requests.
      #### Simple facets
      A simple facet is a special facet that has exactly one value. The facet's type and its value are strictly
      coupled, in a way that a display name for both, facet and value would be redundant. A simple facet generally
      denotes a logical field like 'phone number'. Internally this logical field can map to several internal
      fields (e.g. 'phone_private', 'phone_mobile', 'phone_business'). In clients the facet as a whole can be
      displayed as a single item. Example: "Search for 'term' in field 'phone number'".
      #### Default facets
      A default facet contains multiple values and may be present multiple times in search requests to filter
      results by a combination of different values (e.g. "mails with 'foo' and 'bar' in subject").
      
      Facet values may be one- or two-dimensional. A one-dimensional value can be displayed as is and contains an
      according filter object. A two-dimensional value contains an array "options" with every option defining
      different semantics of how the value is used to filter the search results.
      #### Exclusive facets
      An exclusive facet is a facet where the contained values are mutually exclusive. That means that the facet
      must only be present once in an autocomplete or query request.
      
      Facet values may be one- or two-dimensional. A one-dimensional value can be displayed as is and contains an
      according filter object. A two-dimensional value contains an array "options" with every option defining
      different semantics of how the value is used to filter the search results.

          The name of the module within that the search shall be performed. Possible modules are: mail, contacts,
          calendar, tasks, drive. Because a user may have limited access to modules the useable modules might only
          be a subset of the available ones. Retrieve a list of allowed modules by querying the user configuration,
          see module "config" (path `search`) or module "JSlob" (e.g. `id=io.ox/core`).
