      **SECURITY WARNING!** Utilizing this request is **INSECURE!** This request allows to access a session with a
      single one time token. This one time token may be delivered to the wrong client if the protocol has an
      error or Apache or the load balancer make a mistake. This will cause a wrong user to be in a wrong
      session. **IMMEDIATELY** consider not to use this request anymore. You have been warned. Use instead the
      FormLogin that does not need to use the redirect request.
