    summary: Redeem Token Login.
    description: |
      With a valid session it is possible to acquire a secret (see `token?action=acquireToken`). Using this secret another system is able
      to generate a valid session. This session may also contain the users password (configurable).
      The system in question needs to be registered at the server and has to identify itself with a key
      configured at the open-xchange server. This is only for internal communication and by default no keys
      are available.
