          A JSON object containing an array with data for all folders that are considered as shared by the user.
          Each array element describes one folder and is itself an array. The elements of each array contain the
          information specified by the corresponding identifiers in the `columns` parameter. In case
          of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
