        description: |
          An array with data for new, modified and deleted folders. New and modified folders are represented
          by arrays. The elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding
          identifiers in the `columns` parameter. Deleted folders (should the ignore parameter be ever implemented)
          would be identified by their object IDs as plain strings, without being part of a nested array. In case
          of errors the responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
