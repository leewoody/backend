      #### Saving an iCal email attachment
      If an iCal file is attached to an email, its content can be saved as appointments and tasks into given
      calendar and task folder. If the fields "com.openexchange.groupware.calendar.confirmstatus" and
      "com.openexchange.groupware.calendar.confirmmessage" are set, the data handler inserts the appointment with
      the given status for the user, if the appointment does not exist. If it is already existing, the handler
      just updates the participant status.
      ```json
      {
        "datasource": {
          "identifier":"com.openexchange.mail.ical",
          "args":
          [
            {"com.openexchange.mail.conversion.fullname":"<folder-fullname>"},
            {"com.openexchange.mail.conversion.mailid":"<mail-id>"},
            {"com.openexchange.mail.conversion.sequenceid":"<attachment-sequence-id>"}
          ]
        },
        "datahandler": {
          "identifier":"com.openexchange.ical",
          "args":
          [
            {"com.openexchange.groupware.calendar.folder":"<calendar-folder-id>"},
            {"com.openexchange.groupware.task.folder":"<task-folder-id>"},
            {"com.openexchange.groupware.calendar.confirmstatus":"<status>"},
            {"com.openexchange.groupware.calendar.confirmmessage":"<message>"}
          ]
        }
      }
      ```

      `[{"folder_id":2567,"id":7689}, ...]`.
