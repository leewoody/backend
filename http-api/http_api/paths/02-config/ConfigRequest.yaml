      The configuration is stored in a tree. Each node of the tree has a name and a value.
      The values of leaf nodes are strings which store the actual configuration data. The
      values of inner nodes are defined recursively as objects with one field for each child node.
      The name and the value of each field is the name and the value of the corresponding child
      node, respectively.
