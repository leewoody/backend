        description: Object ID of the folder, whose contents are queried. That parameter may be absent in case ignore is set to "deleted", which means all accessible calendar folders are considered. If ignore is not set to "deleted", that parameter is mandatory.

        description: |
          An array with new, modified and deleted appointments. New and modified appointments are represented by arrays.
          The elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding identifiers in the
          `columns` parameter. Deleted appointments (should the ignore parameter be ever implemented) would be identified
          by their object IDs as integers, without being part of a nested array. Appointment sequencies are broken up
          into individual appointments and each modified occurrence of a sequence in the requested range is returned
          separately. The appointments are sorted in ascending order by the field start_date. In case of errors the
          responsible fields in the response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
