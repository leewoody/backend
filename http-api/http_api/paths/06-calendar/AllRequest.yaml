        description: |
          A JSON object containing an array with appointment data. Each array element describes one appointment and
          is itself an array. The elements of each array contain the information specified by the corresponding
          identifiers in the `columns` parameter. Appointment sequencies are broken up into individual appointments
          and each occurrence of a sequence in the requested range is returned separately. The appointments are
          sorted in ascending order by the field `start_date`. In case of errors the responsible fields in the
          response are filled (see [Error handling](#error-handling)).
