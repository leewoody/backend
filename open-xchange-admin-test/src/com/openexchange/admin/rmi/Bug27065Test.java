 * Tries to reproduce the log messages described in bug 27065. This test does not really test or assert something. Therefore the logs must
 * be readable and the master -> slave replication needs to be slower than calling RMI methods. Especially the second requirement is hard to
 * provide automatically for this test. Maybe a parallel thread that causes high load on the replication can be used for this.
