# Settings in this file (among others) govern, when notification eMails are sent once a task or appointment is modified.
# Whether notification mails are sent is goverened a) by a user specific setting in the configuration b) by
# the checkbox when creating a task/appointment c) by settings in this file.

# a) The user specific setting
# Each user can specify whether he wants to receive notification emails for tasks or appointments. The user can
# set this individually per object type. If the user chooses not to be notified for (say) tasks, that's the end of
# the story, the notification mails won't ever bother her (for tasks). She may choose separately that she's interested
# about appointment notifications, and enable the corresponding feature. This would mean she might be notified of changes
# to appointments in which she is a participant. This is goverened by the other settings.

# b) The checkbox when creating/modifying a task/appointment
# Notice in the dialog when creating or editing an appointment there is a checkbox labeled 'Notify Participants'.
# If this checkbox is enabled, the participants of the task/appointment will be notified of the change (unless their
# user specific setting as per a) suppress that). Also the person creating or changing the object will not get the
# notification mail, because, presumably, she knows what she has been doing. Also the owner is always notified
# of a change to a task/appointment by someone else other than the owner (unless the notification is suppressed as per a) ).

# c) Settings in this file
# Sometimes an action doesn't allow you to check the checkbox under b) but it might still be a good idea to notify
# participants of an action. For example, when deleting an appointment this is usually of great interest to many people.
# So the setting 'notify_participants_on_delete' in this file supersedes the checkbox setting. If set to 'true' all
# participants will be notified when the appointment or task is deleted with the exception of the person deleting
# the appointment/task.


notify_participants_on_delete = true

# Direct links for notifications are generated according to the following pattern.
# [hostname] needs to be replaced with the hostname of your machine. This is done automatically by software on backend machines using the
# hosts canonical host name.
# [uiwebpath] is replaced with the value of com.openexchange.UIWebPath defined in server.properties.
# [module], [object] and [folder] are replaced with the relevant IDs to generate the direct link.
object_link=http://[hostname]/[uiwebpath]#!!&app=io.ox/[module]&id=[object]&folder=[folder]

# Enables/Disables imip-mails for internal users.
imipForInternalUsers = false

# This property defines which email address of a user is used as from header when this user triggers notification mails.
# Possible values are: primaryMail or defaultSenderAddress
com.openexchange.notification.fromSource=defaultSenderAddress

# This property enables/disables the notification Pool for Appointment notifications and invitations.
# If enabled, changes are combined and mails are summarized according different heuristics.
# If disabled, changes are sent immediately.
# Default is true (enabled).
