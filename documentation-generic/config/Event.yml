        This option enables or disable the complete event handling for OX
        The event handling is a essential Open-Xchange component which needs
        to always run. This should only be set to <code>false</code> for debugging purposes.

    - key: com.openexchange.event.eventQueueDelay
      description: |
        This parameter set the delay in milliseconds when events are sent to 
        the subscribed services. Events for example are triggered when deleting
        an appointment with attachment. The event then is for deleting the attachment.
        If this value is increased more events may be in the queue that must be
        executed. This can cause longer runtime delivering all those events. Lowering
        this value may cause too often look into the queue without finding events
        there to process.
