      description: |
        Enables or disables the "drive" module capability globally. The capability
        can also be set more fine-grained via config cascade. Per default it is only
        enabled for users that have the "infostore" permission set. This is configured
        in /opt/open-xchange/etc/contextSets/drive.yml.

      description: |
        Specifies whether the synchronization logic will make use of a folder named
        ".drive" below the root synchronization folder or not. If enabled, this
        folder is used to store temporary uploads and removed files, which usually
        leads to a better user experience since previously synchronized files can
        be restored from there for example. If not, removed files are not kept, and
        uploads are performed directly in the target folder.

      description: |
        Configures the interval between runs of the cleaner process for the
        temporary ".drive" folder. A cleaner run is only initiated if the
        synchronization is idle, i.e. the last synchronization resulted in no
        actions to be performed, and the last run was before the configured
        interval. The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days),
        "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours).

        Defines the maximum age of files and directories to be kept inside the

        before the configured age are deleted during the next run of the cleaner
        process. The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days),

      description: |
        Defines the interval of a periodic background task that performs cleanup 
        operations for cached checksums in the database. The task is executed only 
        once per interval in the cluster, so this value should be equally defined 
        on each node.
        The value can be defined using units of measurement: "D" (=days), 
        "W" (=weeks) and "H" (=hours) with a minimum of "1H" (one hour). 
        A value of "0" disables the periodic background task.

        Allows to limit the maximum used bandwidth for all downloads. If
        configured, downloads via the drive module handled by this backend node will
        not exceed the configured bandwidth. The available bandwidth is defined as
        the number of allowed bytes per second, where the byte value can be
        specified with one of the units "B" (bytes), "kB" (kilobyte), "MB"
        (Megabyte) or "GB" (Gigabyte), e.g. "10 MB". Must fit into the "Integer"
        range, i.e. the configured number of bytes has to be be smaller than 2^31.

        Specifies the maximum allowed number of synchronization operations, i.e.
        all requests to the "drive" module apart from up- and downloads, that the
        server accepts concurrently. While the limit is reached, further
        synchronization requests are rejected in a HTTP 503 manner (service
        unavailable), and the client is instructed to try again at a later time.

        Allows to exclude specific root folders from OX Drive synchronization explicitly. 
        Excluded folders may not be used as root folder for the synchronization, 
        however, this does not apply to their subfolders automatically.
        Excluded folders should be specified in a comma-separated list of their unique identifiers.
        Typical candidates for the blacklist would be folder 15 (the "public folders" root)
