feature_description: |
  Enables download limits (based on donwload counts or sizes)  
  It is possible to define
  <ul>
  <li>limits for guests and links</li>
  <li>limits only for one kind (by setting time frame to 0 = disabled): guests or links</li>
  <li>limits only for count/size (by setting time frame > 0 and size/count = 0): e. g. count for guests and size for links</li>
  </ul>  
  To show all features a possible configuration might be:
  <pre>
  com.openexchange.download.limit.enabled=true // enabled
  com.openexchange.download.limit.timeFrame.guests=3600000 // 60 minutes, set to 0 to disable checks for guests
  com.openexchange.download.limit.timeFrame.links=3600000
  com.openexchange.download.limit.size.guests=0 // disables size check for guests
  com.openexchange.download.limit.size.links=1073741824 // 1GB within 60 minutes
  com.openexchange.download.limit.count.guests=100 // 100 downloads within 60 minutes
  com.openexchange.download.limit.count.links=0 // disables count check for links
  </pre>

    - key: com.openexchange.download.limit.timeFrame.guests
      description: |
        Specifies the limit (in milliseconds) time window in which to track (and possibly 
        deny) incoming download requests for known (guests) guest users.
        That rate limit acts like a sliding window time frame; meaning that it considers only
        requests that fit into time windows specified through [[com.openexchange.download.limit.guests.timeFrame]]  
        from current time stamp:
        <pre>
        window-end := $now
        window-start := $window-end - $timeFrame
        </pre>
        If you only want to specify only one limit (size or count) you have to set a time frame and specify the desired.

        Specifies the limit (in milliseconds) time window in which to track (and possibly

        requests that fit into time windows specified through [[com.openexchange.download.limit.links.timeFrame]]
