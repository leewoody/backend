feature_name: IMAP
feature_description: |
  To differentiate between settings that apply all IMAP accounts or settings that only apply to the primary account
  each property containing the ".primary" suffix allows to specify a value only applicable to the primary account
  by appending the "primary." suffix to properties common "com.openexchange.imap." prefix.  
  E.g.  
  "com.openexchange.imap.imapTimeout=50000" specifies 50sec read timeout for every IMAP account  
  "com.openexchange.imap.primary.imapTimeout=20000" specifies 20sec read timeout for primary-only IMAP account

        Note:  
        This value is going to be set to <code>application</code> if IMAP server capabilities do not contain the string "SORT".

        transfered during reading response which cause a temporary memory peak.
        If disabled only the necessary fields are used as command arguments,
        which is slower but needs less memory.

    - key: com.openexchange.imap.storeContainerType
      description: |
        An IMAP connection cache acts a temporary keep-alive cache for already connected resources to an IMAP server's account.
        Meaning it keeps a resource open/connected for a short amount of time (see [[com.openexchange.mail.mailAccessCacheIdleSeconds]])
        and performs a "close elapsed ones" run periodically (see [[com.openexchange.mail.mailAccessCacheShrinkerSeconds]]).
        
        In addition to that behavior there are two modes of operation - bounded and unbounded.
        
        For an unbounded cache, set this property to <code>unbounded</code>.
        Thus a user is allowed to establish as many connections to his IMAP account as demanded by his active clients (Web UI, EAS, Outlook OXtender, etc.).
        
        A bounded cache allows only as many concurrently opened resources as specified through [[com.openexchange.imap.maxNumConnections]] property.
        Taking the wording "resource" was chosen by intention, since two types of resource abstractions exist:
        IMAP store and IMAP protocol (an authenticated login's socket connection).
        
        The setting <code>boundary-aware</code> considers an "IMAP store" as limited resources to an IMAP server.
        The vague thing about IMAP store is that it maintains a connection pool internally by itself.
        Thus it is possible that there are actually more active socket connections open than specified,
        because an IMAP store is allowed to open further connections when needed;
        e.g. when accessing another IMAP folder while INBOX has been opened, too.
        Practical experience showed that there will be at max.: [[com.openexchange.imap.maxNumConnections]] + 1
        
        The setting <code>non-caching</code> does an exact mapping of resource to an established/authenticated socket connection to the IMAP account.
        It is named <code>non-caching</code> as it does no caching on its own, but delegates it to a custom queuing 'com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPStore' class.
        Thus an exact limitation of connected socket connections ('com.sun.mail.imap.protocol.IMAPProtocol' instances) is achieved.
        Specifying a quite small limitation - let's say "1" - arises the possibility that JavaMail gets dead-locked by itself.
        E.g. an IMAP store attempts to create a second connection. That attempt may get stalled as it waits for itself to free the already
        acquired connection which never happens.
        So, please use this exact mapping only if you specify a reasonable limitation.

      description: |
        Configure the max. number of concurrent connections which are allowed being established to a subscribed/external IMAP account.

        Notation is a comma-separated list of: &lt;host&gt; + ':' + &lt;max-count&gt;; e.g.:  
            com.openexchange.imap.maxNumExternalConnections=imap.host1.com:4, imap.host2.com:6

        For convenience a max-count can be specified which applies to all subscribed/external IMAP accounts; e.g.:  
            com.openexchange.imap.maxNumExternalConnections=4

        Zero or less is interpreted as unlimited.  
        If not set, unlimited concurrent connections are allowed.

      description: |
        This property determines for the primary account whether a fast fetch is performed on large mail
        folders or not. Although the fetch is fast on IMAP side, a lot of data is
        transfered during reading response which cause a temporary memory peak.
        If disabled only the necessary fields are used as command arguments,
        which is slower but needs less memory.

        Note:  
        See property [[com.openexchange.mail.mailFetchLimit]] to know which mail folders are
        treated as large mail folders.
