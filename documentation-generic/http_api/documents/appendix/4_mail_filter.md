# Mail filter

This chapter gives a detailed description of the mail filter module. It should be uses as a source of information in addition to the http api.

First of all the main structure of a mail filter script is, that it has different rules. Each of them contains one command. This command takes a test condition which executes the actions given in that command if the test condition is true.

The test condition consists of a test command and some arguments for this command depending on the command itself. Because the available tests depend on the mail filter server, these tests must be determined at runtime. So that no test field is transferred to the server which it isn't able to handle. Examples for tests are address, allof and anyof.

Each test has a special comparison. The list of available comparisons depends on the test given and the mail filter server configuration so they have to be determined at runtime too.

Each time you want to do some action on a mail you need a so called action command. This describes what to do with a mail. To action commands the same applies as to the test commands and their comparison types, they must be determined at runtime.

All those dynamical values can be fetched via a config object at startup. This object shows the capabilities of the server to the client. This allows the client to show only the capabilities the server actually has to the user and to send only objects to the server which produce no errors on the server side.

To deal with this high flexibility of mail filters this specification can be roughly divided into 2 parts. A non-changing core and dynamical extensions. The core specification is that each rule consists of a name, an ID, a value showing if this rule is active or not and a tag which can be set on a rule to mark that rule for a special purpose. Furthermore each rule takes a test object, specifying in what case the following actions are triggered, and one or many actioncommands, specifying the actions itself.

The objects for the tests and the actions are dynamical, so the set presented in this specification may be changed over the time, but only compatible changes are allowed to the objects, otherwise new test or action objects have to be introduced. Due to the fact that not every sieve implementation will offer all the capabilities written in this document, the server will sent his configuration if a special request is made. This configuration will show which of the tests and which of the actions are allowed. So for example if the server signals that it is capable of handling vacation, sending a vacation object as action is safe.

Furthermore some tests use a comparison field as stated above which specifies how the fields are compared. The values of this field must also be determined at runtime. So in the configuration object there is a special part which shows the comparisons which are available. Note that not all comparisons can be used with every test. Some of them are denoted to a special test, which is described in [Possible comparisons](#possible-comparisons).

## Possible tests

<div class="mailFilterToc">

| Name | Description |
|:------|:-------------|
| [address](#address-test) | This test type applies to addresses only. So it may be used for all header fields which contain addresses. This test returns true if any combination of the header-list and values-list arguments match. |
| [envelope](#envelope-test) | This test applies to the envelope of a mail. This test isn't used under normal circumstances as the envelope isn't accessible in all mail setups. This test returns true if any combination of the header-list and values-list arguments match. |
| [true](#true-test) | A test for a true result (can be used if an action command should be executed every time). |
| [not](#not-test) | Negates a given test. |
| [size](#not-test) | Deals with the size of the mail. |
| [currentdate](#currentdate-test) | Compares a given date with the current date. |
| [header](#header-test) | Tests against all headers of a mail. So with this test in contrast to the address test also fields such as subject can be handled. This test returns true if any combination of the header-list and values-list arguments match. |
| [body](#body-test) | Tests against the content of a mail. |
| [allof](#allof-test) | Defines an AND condition between several tests. |
| [anyof](#anyof-test) | Defines an OR condition between several tests. |
| [date](#date-test) | Compares a given date with the given date header. |
| [exists](#exists-test) | Tests whether a list of headers exist or not. |

</div>


### Simplified tests

The mailfilter v2 api suppports some simplified rules.

<div class="mailFilterToc">

| Name | Description |
|:------|:-------------|
| [subject](#simplified-header-test) | A convenience test to match against a mails subject. |
| [from](#simplified-header-test) | A convenience test to match against a mails From header. |
| [to](#simplified-header-test) | A convenience test to match against a mails To header. |
| [cc](#simplified-header-test) | A convenience test to match against a mails Cc header. |
| [anyRecipient](#simplified-header-test) | A convenience test to match against a mails To and Cc headers. |
| [mailingList](#simplified-header-test) | Matches against common mailing list headers for simple filtering of mailing list mails. |

| matches | Tests if the value matches the value in the specified field ("*" matches zero or more characters, "?" matches a single character, to use these characters themselves they have to be escaped via backslash). |
| not matches | Tests if the value doesn't matches the value in the specified field ("*" matches zero or more characters, "?" matches a single character, to use these characters themselves they have to be escaped via backslash). | 
| regex | Tests if a given regular expression matches with the value present in the specified field. |
