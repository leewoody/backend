title: Drive Mail
---

# How it works
Starting with v7.8.2 the Open-Xchange Server supports to send one or more non-inline file attachments not as physically attached files, but as a mail containing a share link actually providing access to the files.

Whenever such a mail is sent, an according folder is created in Drive module located under a special folder named according to selected [display name](#display-name). The name of the new folder is aligned to the mail's subject. All file attachments that are supposed to be available via the mail are put into that folder and a share link is created for that folder. That share link (along-side with other information) is prepended to the mail's text content.

# Replaces the "publish on exceeded quota" feature

"Drive Mail" is a replacement for the former "publish on exceeded quota" feature. Setups which use the "publish on exceeded quota" feature need to be aware of

 * The ``uploadquota`` and ``uploadquotaperfile`` now do no more act as threshold, which controls when auto-publishing kicks-in. Those quota limitations do specify the user's upload limits. Regardless if a "Drive Mail" is composed or not. Hence, those settings need to be set to reasonable values
 * Existing Drive folders and Drive documents are not removed
 * Auto-deleting of expired published Drive documents does no more happen

# Installation
This feature is included in ``open-xchange-core`` package. Thus, no additional packages are required being installed.

# Configuration
An administrator is able to configure this feature through `/opt/open-xchange/etc/mail-compose.properties` file. All configuration options are config-cascade capable.

## Enabling
The feature is enabled via [com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.enabled](http://documentation.open-xchange.com/components/middleware/config{{ site.baseurl }}/index.html#com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.enabled) property, which defaults to ``true``.

If enabled and user holds sufficient capabilities (_"infostore"_ and _"share_links"_), clients are allowed to signal that a mail is supposed to be sent containing a share link, rather than actual file attachments, through enhancing the JSON request body of the ``/mail?action=new`` call:

```
 {
  "from", ["Jane Doe", "jane.doe@somewhere.com"],
  ...
  "share_attachments": {
   "enable": true,
   "expiry_date": 1465219133000, <-- Specifies when share link is about to expire
   "password": "secret"          <-- Specifies an optional password access the share link
   "autodelete": true            <-- Specifies whether share expiration should also delete shared files
  }
 }
```

## Display name

It is possible to change the display name of that feature according to customer needs through [com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.name](http://documentation.open-xchange.com/components/middleware/config{{ site.baseurl }}/index.html#com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.name) option. Default is _Drive Mail_.

## Threshold

Since file attachments are not physically attached, but stored in Drive of sending user, a user can be forced to send a share link through specifying property [com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.threshold](http://documentation.open-xchange.com/components/middleware/config{{ site.baseurl }}/index.html#com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.threshold). That option accepts a threshold, which is the total number of bytes of all file attachments that are allowed to be sent physically attached. Once exceeded the file attachments are made accessible via a share link.

## External recipient locale
The option [com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.externalRecipientsLocale](http://documentation.open-xchange.com/components/middleware/config{{ site.baseurl }}/index.html#com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.externalRecipientsLocale) specifies what locale to use when composing a mail containing share information for an external recipient.

This option either accepts special value ``user-defined`` (that is to choose sending user's locale) or a locale identifier according to RFC 2798 and 2068; such as ``en_US``.

## Share attributes
By default a user can optionally specify whether a share link has an expiry date and if (provided a expiry date is set) the associated folder is automatically deleted from Drive module if share link is expired.

An administrator can enforce, whether an expiry date and an accompanying auto-delete flag is required.

 - [com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.requiredExpiration](http://documentation.open-xchange.com/components/middleware/config{{ site.baseurl }}/index.html#com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.requiredExpiration) (default id ``false``). If set to ``true``, the user is required to specify an expiry date for the created share link. Otherwise sending the mail is rejected.
 - [com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.forceAutoDelete](http://documentation.open-xchange.com/components/middleware/config{{ site.baseurl }}/index.html#com.openexchange.mail.compose.share.forceAutoDelete) (default id ``false``). If set to ``true``, the files/folder associated with the share will be automatically deletes once the share link expires.
