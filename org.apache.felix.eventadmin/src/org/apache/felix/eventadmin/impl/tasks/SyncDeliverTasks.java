/**
 * This class does the actual work of the synchronous event delivery.
 *
 * This is the heart of the event delivery. If an event is delivered
 * without timeout handling, the event is directly delivered using
 * the calling thread.
 * If timeout handling is enabled, a new thread is taken from the
 * thread pool and this thread is used to deliver the event.
 * The calling thread is blocked until either the deliver is finished
 * or the timeout occurs.
 * <p><tt>
 * Note that in case of a timeout while a task is disabled the thread
 * is released and we spin-off a new thread that resumes the disabled
 * task hence, this is the only place were we break the semantics of
 * the synchronous delivery. While the only one to notice this is the
 * timed-out handler - it is the fault of this handler too (i.e., it
 * blocked the dispatch for to long) but since it will not receive
 * events anymore it will not notice this semantic difference except
 * that it might not see events it already sent before.
 * </tt></pre>
 *
 * If during an event delivery a new event should be delivered from
 * within the event handler, the timeout handler is stopped for the
 * delivery time of the inner event!
